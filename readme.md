Image Slider Plugin

The image slider contains two functions. One for the next button and one for the previous button.

Usage

Simply add the HTMl element you want the image slider to work on by passing it as argument. Do the same for where you want the event to be run on by passing in the element in the event function parameter.

Example

$("#next").nextImg("#next");
$("#prev").prevImg("#prev");
